# Description of the game:
    This is a simple game with an Ice-cream theme. To play,  just guess a letter by chosing  a letter from the keyboard. If you guess incorrectly 10 times, you lose. If you guess the word before that happens, you win. After you win or lose, you can restart the game by pressing the( Play again) button.

    The idea of the game is the disappearance of the ice-cream elements with every mistake the player makes by guessing the wrong letter.
    The player must guesses the word to enjoy eating his ice-cream.

# The approach taken:
    HTML , CSS , JavaScript and DOM

# 
    I defined the variables and the elements, and create divs for alphabets letters using for loop and DOM.
    To active the click letters I used (click event) ... 


# unsolved problems
1- I had a problem with stopping the game when determining the winner or the loser, as the letters are still can be pressed.
2- I couldn't activate my removeImage function due to time constraints, which I am not sure if my function will work or not.
3- styling my winner and looser message.
